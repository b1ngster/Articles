<!-- l. 35 --><p class='noindent'>This blog is rendered using the using GitHub action provided by using Tex and
GitHub pages using Make4ht and GitHub actions Tex is rendered in HTML and
MathML. Thanks to this <a href='https://github.com/michal-h21/overleaf-html-sample'>Repo</a>, that provides a link to a Docker container running
Make4ht. This workflow does not require Overleaf as it works well using other editors
such as TexMaker.

<!-- l. 40 --><p class='noindent'>I have missed my goal to create a blog post each day, much like Pamala Anderson.
Yesterday was difficult as I was unable to make make4ht use citations which is
something make4ht is capable of. It seems the container which make4ht runs on does
not have the package and requires an additional package, ”texlive-bibtex-extra”,
which when I have tried to install this via GitHub actions, it says not found;
however, make4ht documentation highlights that it can run biber via a configuration
file but still when I have tried to run this the container error BibTeX. I
am planning on raising an issue, but unsure if this is an issue caused by
myself.
