<p>. Evolutionary architectures are designed to accommodate changes and improvements
in software by employing a fitness function that evaluates the system’s performance
against specific objectives. Software requirements are essential in defining the
structure and functionality of software systems. They encompass various aspects such
as performance, security, and scalability. Such as security measures, are crucial,
Requirements are not static and evolve over time.
</p> 
<p>   Security is critical in software development; protecting sensitive data that should
not be exposed or unprotected. Implementing security measures, such as encryption,
access controls, and secure storage, is crucial to safeguard sensitive information. but
can have a negative impact on performance. Logging and monitoring are closely
related practices in software systems. Logging involves recording events, errors, and
important information during runtime, while monitoring focuses on observing the
system’s performance, availability, and other metrics. Both logging and monitoring
provide valuable insights into the system’s behaviour and help identify issues and
performance bottlenecks.
</p> 
<p>   Architectural governance helps prevent system degradation over time by
establishing guidelines and best practices to maintain its integrity. Adopting a
continuous architecture approach allows for incremental and adaptable development.
It aligns with agile methodologies, enabling iterative improvements and responding to
feedback and changing needs. This iterative approach also enables the application of
genetic algorithms, which can optimize the system’s architecture based on a defined
fitness function.
</p> 
<p>   An architectural fitness function provides an objective measure to evaluate the
quality and effectiveness of an architecture. It defines criteria, such as performance,
scalability, maintainability, and security, against which the architecture is assessed.
This fitness function guides the decision-making process and helps drive architectural
improvements. By embracing continuous architecture, leveraging genetic algorithms,
and employing an architectural fitness function, software systems can be developed
and maintained to promote adaptability, efficiency, and alignment with business
objectives.
</p> 
<p>   Proper definition and understanding of the software’s domain are vital.
Domain-Driven Design promotes the use of a ubiquitous language, which enables
effective communication between stakeholders and developers. In addition to
domain-specific considerations, non-functional requirements, also known as system
requirements or architectural characteristics, play a significant role in software
design. These requirements address factors such as performance, scalability, and
security.
</p> 
<p>   Customer-driven contracts are a concept in software development where the
contracts between different components or services are defined based on the
customers’ or users’ specific needs and expectations. This approach helps align the
                                                                  

                                                                  
interactions and collaborations between different components to meet customer
requirements effectively. When tackling complex problems, it is essential to consider
non-domain design considerations. These factors go beyond the specific domain and
encompass broader aspects of software development. Solutions to such problems often
involve adopting proven design patterns, employing robust architectures, and
utilizing appropriate technologies.
</p> 
<p>   Software changes are often driven by business requirements and the need to adapt
to evolving circumstances. Such as scalability which is addressed through
well-designed architectures that handle increasing workloads and growing user
demands. This may involve implementing distributed systems, load-balancing
techniques, and horizontal or vertical scaling strategies. These requirements
must be properly defined, evaluated, and adapted from performance and
security to scalability as the system evolves. Non-domain considerations and
architectural characteristics play a crucial role in ensuring the success of software
solutions.
</p> 
<p>   Automated verification processes play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and
correctness of these changes.Building for change is an ongoing process that requires
careful consideration and planning.
</p> 
<p>   Tests in software development can be categorized as atomic or holistic. Atomic
tests focus on individual units or components, verifying their functionality in
isolation. Holistic tests assess the system, examining the interactions and integration
between various components. These tests can be triggered at specific points or
executed continuously to ensure ongoing validation.
</p> 
<p>   Tests provide static or dynamic results based on scalability, concurrency, and
performance metrics. They can include predefined thresholds or ranges to evaluate
the system’s behaviour under varying conditions. Automated tests and verification
processes are executed without human interaction, allowing for efficient and
consistent validation.
</p> 
<p>   Manual testing involves human intervention, where testers interact with the
system, inputs, and outputs, evaluating its behaviour and identifying potential issues.
Temporal testing focuses on verifying time-dependent aspects of a system, such as
data synchronization or event sequencing. Domain-specific testing considers a
particular domain’s unique requirements and characteristics, tailoring the testing
approach to address specific challenges and objectives.
</p> 
<p>   Unit, functional, and acceptance testing are common types of testing performed
in software development. Unit tests focus on validating the functionality of
individual units or components of the software. Functional tests verify that
the system meets the specified functional requirements. Acceptance tests
ensure that the software meets the end users’ or customers’ expectations and
requirements.
</p> 
<p>   Chaos engineering is a practice that involves intentionally introducing failures and
disruptions into a system to assess its resiliency and identify potential weaknesses. By
subjecting a system to controlled chaos, engineers can gain insights into its behaviour
under adverse conditions and improve its robustness. Chaos Monkey and the Simian
Army are tools or frameworks developed by Netflix for testing and improving the
resilience of their systems. Chaos Monkey introduces random failures in the
                                                                  

                                                                  
system to ensure it can withstand unexpected failures. Simian Army includes
additional tools like Janitor Monkey, which helps clean up unused resources,
and Conformity Monkey, which enforces best practices and configuration
standards.
</p> 
<p>   Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that
encourages writing tests before writing the actual code. It promotes good
programming practices by ensuring the code meets the specified requirements and
behaves as expected.
</p> 
<p>   Afferent and efferent coupling measures how dependent a module or component is
on other modules (afferent) and how much it depends on external modules (efferent).
These measures help assess the complexity and interdependencies within a software
system.
</p> 
<p>   The Strategy Design Pattern is a software design pattern that helps reduce a
system’s complexity by encapsulating interchangeable algorithms or behaviours into
separate classes, allowing flexibility and easy behaviour modification without
modifying the core logic.
</p> 
<p>   Cyclic dependency is an antipattern in software development where components
or modules have interdependent relationships, resulting in tight coupling and
decreased maintainability. <strong><span class='cmbx-10'>JDepend </span></strong>can be used to identify and analyze cyclic
dependencies within a codebase.
</p> 
<p>   Tools like
</p> 
<p>   ArchUnit is a Java library that provides a fluent API for testing and
asserting architectural rules in code. It allows developers to define and enforce
architectural constraints, such as package dependencies and class naming
conventions.
</p> 
<p>   Cyclomatic complexity is a metric used to measure the complexity of a
program by counting the number of independent paths through the code. It
provides insights into the potential test cases needed to achieve full code
coverage.
</p> 
<p>   Crap4j is a tool that assesses code quality based on metrics like cyclomatic
complexity, code coverage, and code duplication. It helps identify areas of code
that may need improvement or refactoring to enhance maintainability and
readability.
</p> 
<p>   Nagios is an open-source monitoring and alerting system widely used in the
industry. It allows monitoring of various resources and services, providing
notifications and alerts in case of issues or failures. Synthetic transactions are
simulated interactions or transactions performed within a system to validate its
functionality, performance, and response. These transactions help assess the system’s
behaviour and identify any issues or bottlenecks.
</p> 
<p>   SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools like SonarQube analyze source
code or compiled binaries for security vulnerabilities, code smells, and other
issues. These tools help identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide
recommendations for remediation.
</p> 
<p>   <strong><span class='cmbx-10'>Pact.io </span></strong>is a testing framework that allows contract testing between service
providers and consumers. It ensures that services communicate and integrate
correctly by defining and validating contracts.

<p><strong><span class='cmbx-12x-x-120'>Sofja Wassiljewna Kowalewskaja</span></strong><br />
<em><span class='cmti-10'>15 January 1850 - 10 February 1891</span></em><br />
 <img alt='PIC' height='150' src='images/bios/Kowalewskaja.png' width='150' />
</p> 
<p>   Kovalevskaya was the first woman to gain a degree for her contributions to
mathematics. She was also known for her literary works and her activism for women’s
rights. Born Sofia Vasilievna Krukovsky, she was called Sophie, an anglicized version
of Sofia. Among her friends, she was known as Sonya or Sonja. Kovalevskaya is the
feminine form of her husband’s name, Kovalevsky, which is sometimes transliterated
as Kovalevskaia or Kovalevskaja. As a child, Sofja Kolwalewskaja’s bedroom walls
were wallpapered with her father’s mathematics notes from his student days. This
was because they had ordered one roll short of wallpaper, and the mathematical
notes intrigued her. Born into a minor noble family, she was fortunate enough to
receive tutoring in elementary mathematics. Later, she received calculus
tutoring from Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate for women’s higher
education.
</p> 
<p>   When her older sister met the son of a local priest, Anyuta, inspired by his
university studies, decided to go to St. Petersburg to live and proposed living in a
commune with young people without servants. However, her father did not allow this,
and in response, Anyuta secretly wrote and published two pieces under a
male pseudonym. As a woman, Sofja faced limitations in completing her
education in Russia. In 1868, she entered a ”fictitious marriage” with Vladimir
Kovalevskij so they could go to Vienna, where she studied physics while he studied
palaeontology.
</p> 
<p>   They spent several months in St. Petersburg studying various subjects
before moving to the University of Heidelberg in 1869. She attended physics
courses by Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Robert Bunsen
there. She also studied mathematics with Leo Königsberger and Professor
Paul du Bois-Reymond, both Weierstrass students. In 1869, during a trip to
London with Vladimir, she attended George Eliot’s Sunday salons, where she
met Herbert Spencer. This encounter led to a debate on ”woman’s capacity
for abstract thought,” which may have inspired a passage in Eliot’s novel
Middlemarch.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p> 
<p>   In October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began private lessons
with Karl Weierstrass. Weierstrass was often referred to as the ”father of modern
analysis” and significantly impacted Kovalevskaya’s work. They formed a close
intellectual and personal relationship beyond the typical teacher-student dynamic.
Over eighteen months, she wrote three dissertations under Weierstrass’s guidance and
presented papers on partial differential equations, the dynamics of Saturn’s rings, and
elliptic integrals. Her work on partial differential equations included the
Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem, which proves the existence and uniqueness of local
solutions for analytic partial differential equations associated with Cauchy’s initial
value problems.
</p> 
<p>   In 1878, Sofia and Vladimir had a daughter nicknamed ”Foufie.” Sofia faced
challenges securing a professorship due to her gender, while Vladimir’s radical beliefs
hindered his career prospects. They tried various schemes to make money. After
raising their daughter, Sofia left Vladimir and resumed her work in mathematics. In
1883, she accepted a teaching position at the University of Stockholm, where she
became the editor of the mathematics journal Acta Mathematica. She was the first
woman to hold this title and received the Prix Bordin award from the French
Academy of Science.
</p> 
<p id='sofja-kowalewskaja'>   Sofia developed a close friendship with Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, the sister
of Mittag-Leffler, a mathematician who played a significant role in Sofia’s career.
Together, they wrote stage plays and a memoir titled ”A Russian Childhood.” Sofia
also wrote ”Nihilist Girl” in 1890, a semi-autobiographical account of her life. In June
1889, she became the first woman to hold a chair at a European university since the
physicist Laura Bassi in 1750. Tragically, Sofia died from pneumonia at forty-one
while returning from a vacation.
