<p>I am reflecting on the last year, 2022, when I was studying Msc Applied Data
Science. I thought I had until 4th January; however, in December, I got told this was
just a glitch in the system and stopped being a student in September. So the course
started on 4th October 2022. I started later that year after receiving my BSc
Degree certificate late in October. The course started well, although the first
payment I paid to the university for the course didn’t go to my account due to
my name getting misspelt (thanks to covid masks at the bank). Later, my
banks, Eccount and Uaccount, went into administration and buggered up my
life.
</p> 
<p>   The course was in the school of engineering, and I learnt a lot that I did not
expect: electrical engineering and renewable energy. In the first semester, we studied
Research Methods and Artificial Intelligence for my elective; I did Digital Image and
Signal Processing, a 75 percent exam which I was sure I would fail. The others were
50 percent coursework and 50 percent exam. Although I knew I would fail, the
subject was interesting... And if I could figure out where the buttons were on the
calculator, I was in for a chance, but I couldn’t find the button; I tried to use my
newfound knowledge that sine is the derivative of cosine. It didn’t work out,
but Research Methods have interested me greatly, and that deadline was
sooner.
</p> 
<p>   In Research Methods. A member of my class and I was teamed with two people
from the Msc Renewable energy course to evaluate monitored data from two real
photovoltaic systems located at UCLAN against simulated data. For the assignment,
we were assigned roles the people from renewable energy were to provide a literature
review, the other person from my course was to do the simulation, and I was the
validate the simulated and monitored data. I didn’t assign myself the role but took
on the part. Our tutor assigned roles; this was strange because the assignment
required us to write about using an Agile methodology and having roles ensured that
we used a waterfall methodology. Agile development requires a team to communicate
regularly to create an iteration of the product. Unfortunately, the team
communicated via WhatsApp, which was unfortunate not having a mobile telephone
myself. I thought we were using Microsoft Teams, and everyone was too busy
researching.

<p>   As you can see, I took on validating the monitored data. So I needed to learn how
to verify and validate simulated data. Unfortunately, I did not have experience doing
this or a Windows computer to create the simulation (I could have used
WINE or a Virtual Machine hired from FFS). So the task was to validate the
simulation, ensuring input and output were between a range of possible
values.
</p> 
<p>   There are many ways of modelling a system; it can be modelled in terms of its
input and output using equations such as Partial and Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODE); they are used to model phenomena such as heat transfer; indeed,
photovoltaic systems have similarities with the heat conduction problem as they
convert heat into electrical energy. To solve these equations, numerical techniques
such as root-finding methods such as the Newton, Secant and polynomial root-finding
techniques and often are used when there is no analytical solution. Unfortunately,
computer systems are prone to truncation errors due to the finite precision of
numbers and are considered unavoidable errors which occur when a continuous
function is approximated; another is the effect of solar radiation on the computing
system.
</p> 
<p>   I found the use of polynomials interesting, as this was the first time I had
encountered them since school. They were also studied while studying Artificial
Intelligence; using them for prediction in regression analysis, the inputs can be
modified to measure the effect on output. They provide a simple mathematical
model, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to measure improvements
made by adding more or fewer polynomials. And solve PDE and ODEs can also be
converted into them, although this is what we were still researching at the time.
Another interesting thing is that they are used to prove the existence of complex
numbers in the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. And solve PDE and ODE can be
converted into equations too - although I was not aware of this then, and the
recommended reading pointed to an auto-regressive parameter estimation
method.
</p> 
<p>   Bohr’s atom model can identify things such as if an atom is likely to be
conductive, as it identifies how many and the positions of the electrons in the atom.
Neutrons and photons are made of quarks top, bottom, charm, strange, up,
and down whereas electrons are fundamental particles like quarks. Bohr’s
model considers particles to be physical objects orbiting a centre. However,
Thomas Young demonstrated the wave–particle duality through the double-slit
experiment in 1802, and the theory is demonstrated in many books on quantum
computing; it identifies that electrons do not just act as a particle. Heinrich
Hertz proved the existence of electromagnetic waves by using a spark gap
transmitter.
</p> 
<p>   Photocells only use one photon to push the electron into the valence band (or
shell), which is the outer shell of electrons and happens photon is within
a specific wavelength range. Different materials have different abilities to
transmit electricity. This highlights another method - optical modelling,
which could determine if the material has deformities, as a photovoltaic
cell is made out of different materials, which produce different amounts of
                                                                  

                                                                  
electricity.
</p> 
<p>   Most textbooks create an electrical circuit model; I followed a text recreating it in
Matlab, which produced IV curves. Unfortunately, I needed help with the code and
requested the book’s publisher for its source code, but they only provided that to
lectures. I also contacted one of the book’s authors, but he didn’t have it; the code
was from the other author. But by that time, I found other resources. Matlab
provides several modelling methods, such as Simulink, where components can be
developed in a drag-and-drop interface defining their attributes. I choosen to use the
pure code approach, which enabled a greater understanding of the system’s inner
workings.
</p> 
<p>   I used Villalva’s photovoltaic model, which uses two cells. These account for the
non-linearity, but this does not occur just in photovoltaic cells in Duffy (2016)
Advanced Engineering highlights the work of Fairweather and Ingham (1941):
Subsidence transients in resistors containing none linear resistor with reference to the
problem of spark quenching explains that a non-linear component is more realistic in
a circuit, having more than a non-linear component has a dramatic effect on the
output. Indeed, more than one cell must be simulated as we compare two
photovoltaic panels containing many cells. Thankfully, IV curves are also one of the
outputs of the PV software. Plank’s law allows the measurement of energy as discrete
values.
</p> 
<p>   A book provided a model of the sun’s irradiation, and a model of the system, if
inputs are correct, should give the output that would correspond to that of the real
and simulated data. So the data’s distribution matched the actual data and the
simulated but not the actual values. Indeed the weather also affects the solar array,
and forecasting the weather is challenging. Several other things need to be
considered: the solar array is connected to an inverter, and the electrical
grid to which it is connected imparts their characteristics. The simulation
software that was used to recreate the actual data can utilise 3D object
files to play locations and the shadows of buildings. Partial shadows and
clouds affect the photovoltaic array, which may not have been accounted
for.
</p> 
<p>   Matlab was used for much of the course; it is an appealing language for
engineers because it has functions to help solve equations. It requires a licence
which prevents it from being portable and expensive, and difficult to scale in
Linux: the user needs to run an activation script before startup, which occurs
regularly. Fortunately, Octane is open source and uses a similar syntax and has
similar features, but it lacks the many plugins which Matlab has, such as
the Curve Fitting Tool, which we used in Artificial Intelligence. I would
like to revisit this code, but I am not enrolled on the course at the time of
writing.
</p> 
<p>   In the module: Programming with Data, we used Juypyter Notebooks to program
in Python; however, it also supports Julia and R, and the cells can be annotated with
Markdown and render Latex. During Artificial Intelligence, we used Juypyter
Notebooks, Python and TensorFlow during a class about Deep Learning. I noted the
difficulty I was having with producing equations in Microsoft Word, finding using
writing them in Latex a better alternative to the drag-and-drop interface which it
                                                                  

                                                                  
offered. Indeed, in the second coursework of Programming with Data, we
used R, which to supports Latex via R Markdown. The good thing about
being able to use equations in your code is to be able to share code with
people who are not familiar with the programming language and to use
proofs and reasoning; a cool thing I would like to see is a library to compile
equations into computer programs, and I don’t think it is far too from been
developed.
