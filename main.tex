 This blog is rendered using the using GitHub action provided by using Tex and GitHub pages using Make4ht and GitHub actions Tex is rendered in HTML and MathML. Thanks to this
\urllink{Repo}{https://github.com/michal-h21/overleaf-html-sample}, that provides a link to a Docker container running Make4ht. This workflow does not require Overleaf as it works well using other editors such as TexMaker.


\section{\date{1 February 2023}}
 I have missed my goal to create a blog post each day, much like Pamala Anderson. Yesterday was difficult as I was unable to make make4ht use citations which is something make4ht is capable of. It seems the container which make4ht runs on does not have the package and requires an additional package, "texlive-bibtex-extra",  which when I have tried to install this via GitHub actions, it says not found; however, make4ht documentation highlights that it can run biber via a configuration file but still when I have tried to run this the container error BibTeX. I am planning on raising an issue, but unsure if this is an issue caused by myself.
